### Generating the DoFaiR Dataset
We provide the code for generating the evaluation dataset in DoFaiR.
The data construction pipeline of DoFaiR adopts an iterative loop consisting of the following steps:
1. Generate historical events and participants from seed information;
2. Create queries for retrieving factual information;
3. Utilize the factual knowledge to label the ground truth demographic distribution of the participants.

Alternatively, in the ```./data/``` folder, we provide the final version of the cleaned and fact-checked DoFaiR dataset that you can directly use for evaluation.

#### Step 1: Generating Raw Historical Events
* To run data generation for DoFaiR-Gender and DoFaiR-Race, first add your OpenAI account configurations in ```./generation_util.py```.
* Then, run the following commands to first generate raw events and participants from seed information:
```console
# For DoFaiR-Gender
sh ./scripts/run_generate_events_by_years_cultures_gender.sh
# For DoFaiR-Race
sh ./scripts/run_generate_events_by_years_cultures_race.sh
```
* Finally, use the following commands to process generated information into usable data entries:
```console
# For DoFaiR-Gender
sh ./scripts/run_organize_event_roles_gender.sh
# For DoFaiR-Race
sh ./scripts/run_organize_event_roles_race.sh
```

#### Step 2 & 3: Query Generation, Fact-Checkingï¼Œ and Gold Demographic Distribution Labeling
* To run the fact-checking pipeline with query generation, fact
